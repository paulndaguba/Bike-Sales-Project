# Bike-Sales-Project

This dataset was gotten from Kaggle.com - It comprises of bike sales from over 3 continents (Europe, North America and Oceania).
It also comprises of informations like; Marital Status, Gender, Educational Background, Occupation, Bike Commute Distance, Age, e.tc.

One of the things I've learnt whilst carrying out a project in Excel is; Always create a different worksheet from your raw data and copy the data onto the new worksheet, so if ever you make a mistake you do not have to start all over again. Another thing is, one of the first things to do while cleaning is - Always check for and remove duplicates.
So on this project, I had 4 different worksheets; 1. Raw data. 2. For cleaning. 3. Making Pivot Table. 4. My Dashboard.

More on the things I learnt on this project; While cleaning, I learnt about the "UPPER, LOWER and PROPER" Functions.
I used the Find & Replace Function to change the M,S & M,F to Married & Single, Male & Female in the "Marital Status and Gender Column" respectively.
I also used the "TRIM" Function to remove any unseen spaces in the data. I also used a "Nested IF Statement" to create a new column named - Age Bracket.

Moving onto Visualization; I created four pivot tables,and analysed as follows: 
1. Average Income Per Purchase.
2. Customer Age Bracket.
3. Sales by Region.
4. Customer Commute.
And then, I worked on my dashboard and learned about "Slicer" which allows you to filter your visualizations.
